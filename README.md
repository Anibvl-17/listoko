# Listoko!  
Welcome to **Listoko**, a simple yet powerful _to-do_ list website. It is built as part of the [The Odin Project JavaScript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

## Features  
- **Today Section**: Stay focused by managing tasks specifically for today.  
- **Quicklist**: Need to write something down in a hurry? Create a quick list that’s saved until you reset it.  
- **All My To-Dos**: A complete overview of all your tasks, including unassigned ones.  
- **Projects**: Easily group and manage tasks by project.  
- **Quick To-Do Assignment**: Save time by assigning tasks to projects right as you create them.  
- **Priority Sorting**: Focus on what’s important with priority tagging—your most urgent tasks always come first.  
- **Task Deadlines**: Set due dates for your tasks and highlight overdue ones.  
- **Checklist Items**: Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.  
- **Completion Stats**: See your progress with completion percentages or counts of completed vs. pending tasks.  

With **local storage integration**, your lists are saved automatically, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## Future Ideas
After the website is fully functional, the following features might be added:

- **Search/Filter**: Quickly find tasks or projects using search or filtering options. (Not started)
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes for a personalized user experience.  (Not started)
